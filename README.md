# Description
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that i created while practicing my skills i have in javascript and trying to improve them. The website at the time of writing is definitely not responsive :(

# Instructions
-   Player X always begins the game.
-   You can reset the game at any point you like by clicking on the reset button in the bottom of the page.
-   Go to this [link](https://firasaz.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) to play the game!
